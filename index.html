This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a hetergeneous
classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
to using a single type of classification model thorughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that..

	  The development of smart wings is an immense leap in innovation in Aerospace achieved using adaptive aerodynamics, advanced materials and embedded intelligence to achieve unseen efficiency and control. 
	  Traditional wings are self-limiting, optimised for small range of conditions unable to adapt to the fluctuating aerodynamic demands. 
	  Smart wings overcome these limitations with the integration of three technologies including morphing structures, piezoelectric sensing and plasma based flow control 
	  Morphing wings much like bird’s flight can flexibly camber or twist optimise lift, drag, and maneuverability across regimes of flight. 
	  These wings will change shape to meet the aerodynamic demands of any condition from take-off to cruising. 
	  Piezoelectric sensors are the receptors and effectors of the wing translating mechanical strain into electrical signals just like the Pacinian Corpuscles in humans. In addition, Plasma actuators influence the surrounding airflow by ionising it, enhancing lift and delay flow separation.
	  These innovations target major Aerospace obstacles including fuel efficiency, aerodynamic control and performance. 
	  Together, they represent the step towards a new era of intelligent aircrafts. Envision a wing which adapts like a bird, feels stress like a nerve, and controls air without flaps

    Bridge Deck repair durability is the subject of much recent research such as in <a href="https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/full/10.1680/jbren.21.00034">Tosihiko et al (2023).</a> Table 1: Data on cost and lifespan of bridge repairs.
	Like previously said, Morphing Wings are wings which can flexibly change shape in flight to maximise performance and fulfil the aerodynamic demand on the aircraft very much like birds such as peregrine falcons and hawks. It can do this in various ways such as using Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) patches and Piezoelectric actuators. “Shape memory alloy (SMA) is a functional metal with unique properties that allow it to be trained to move on its own. SMAs can go through solid-state phase transformations, meaning they can be stretched, bent, heated, and cooled and still remember its original shape.” (Lilly, 2025) So, it literally “memorises” its shape and will return to it with just a bit of temperature stimulus. This remarkable property is used in Morphing wings aiding structural deformation. When it is heated using an electrical current or internal heating elements, SMAs can incite changes in wing shape, such as bending or twisting, without the need for complex mechanical parts. Advantages of SMAs include its High Energy Density and its Lightness, its HED means it can induce large deformations with minimal energy input. With SMAs being light will reduce the aircrafts overall weight, translating to improved fuel efficiency and performance. However, SMAs disadvantages include Temperature Control, Response Time and Durability. SMAs require precise temperature regulation, which can be difficult to maintain in fluctuating environmental conditions. In addition, the response time of SMAs may be slower compared to other actuation methods which limits their application in rapid aerodynamic changes. Furthermore, SMAs can degrade overtime due to repeated cycling through the phase transitions which affects their long-term performance. 
	A great example of the use of SMAs in the Aerospace Industry was by the NASA’s revolutionary tire tech made for the Mars rover to traverse the Red Planet’s rugged surface. NASA’S SMA consisted of nickel and titanium, “these metals can accommodate deformation despite extreme stress, permitting the tires to return to their original shape even with rigorous impact, which is not possible for spring tires made with conventional metal”. (Lilly, 2025). They have already tested prototypes of the tire on Martian simulated terrain at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and received amazing results The use of SMAs greatly reduced plasticizing compared with the traditional steel tires they used. The advantages of High Energy Density and simplicity of SMAs make it highly attractive. However, issues related to slow response times, temperature control and material degradation will limit their long term application. 
	Morphing Wings can also be achieved using MFC (Macro Fiber Composite) patches, they are Piezoelectric-based actuators that consist of long, thin fibers embedded within a composite matrix. Then these fibers deform in response to voltage inputs, creating bending or twisting motions on the wing surface. Enabling the wing to adapt to the varying aerodynamic demands of the wing in the changing environmental conditions. By bonding the MFCs to the skin of the wing, it can locally manipulate the wing’s shape. This ensures the overall performance and integrity of the wing is not compromised. Some of the pros of MFC patches include Precise Deformation, Lightweight, High – Frequency Response and Scalability. MFCs provide fine control over small deformations, this makes them ideal for applications such as aerodynamic control and drag reduction. Furthermore, MFCs are made from lightweight materials such as PZT, epoxy matrix and Polyimide film. This means the overall weight of the aircraft is reduced which boosts fuel efficiency and performance. 
	Contrasting to SMAs, MFCs patches have a High – Frequency Response which enables them to respond quickly allowing for rapid adaptation to changing aerodynamic conditions in real time. However, MFCs usually provides small changes compared with other actuators, this limits their ability to make large scale changes for Morphing Wings. In addition, MFCs have a higher cost of manufacturing compared with other conventional aircraft hardware. This will result in reduced profitability for its future customers. Another challenge of MFCs is the high temperature, these patches can be challenging to apply and carbon composites can also affect the performance of the adhesive bond. Finally, the success of the bonded MFC repairs is heavily dependent on the integrity of the adhesive bond, which can be affected by factors such as temperature and adhesive thickness 
	To conclude Shape Memory Alloys and Macro Fiber Composite patches together represent two of the most promising advances driving the revolution of the Morphing Wing systems. SMAs induce large, smooth deformations by manipulating the solid state phase transformations using a heat stimulus, while MFCs provide precise, high frequency control over a local surface changes. When these two innovations are integrated into a morphing wing structure, these technologies can mimic the adaptive flights of birds and bats enabling them to continuously reshape for the most optimal aerodynamic efficiency. The combined advantages of drag reduction and improved lift drag ratios and the removal of the traditional hinged control surfaces offer a lighter, quieter and stealthier aircraft. As research continues to refine these futuristic advancements SMA and MFC based Morphing Wings will redefine the standards for aircrafts – ushering in a new era of adaptive, high performance Aerospace Engineering
